1. ~Remove dependency from opencv and read in bake up your own image reader in C++ ~
    - And fix up the occurences of cv
2. change matrix opperation structure
    - Dont copy matrix in backpropogation
    - Write a custom update matrix function for backprop
3. optimize linear algebra library
    - build sparse matrix class
    - optimize multiplication
    - fix / add subroutines
        - xROTG
        - xROTMG
        - xSCAL
        - xGEMV
        - xGEMM
        - xSYMM
        - xSPR

4. CUDA
    Build a gpu compatible cuda matrix library

5. Clean up imports and namespaces so that includes aren't exposing imports
